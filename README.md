# desultory-collection-of-algo-implementations

My plan is to collect different implementations of algorithms and programming paradigms in their generic form or by using toy problems. The idea is that this would help me to quickly review an algo implementation or reuse the material in a larger problem.

Some of the programs in this repository are just some cool hacks I came up with like stayUp.py just makes use of OpenCV and the webcam to make sure that the user doesn't doze off. Nexus9Notif.py keeps on checking if Nexus9 has become available(made before the launch of Nexus 9) and alerts the user when it is available using simple scraping techniques.
